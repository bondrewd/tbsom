# Linear Algebra

### Motivation 1

We can use linear algebra when we have variables ($a$, $b$, $c$, $d$), unknowns ($x$, $y$, $z$), and simple relations between them, and we want to find all the solutions for the unknowns ($x$, $y$, $z$).

### Motivation 2

We can generalize things by working at the abstract level using **vector spaces** and **linear maps**. However, we will start at the concrete level using $\mathbb{R}^n$ and **matrices**.
