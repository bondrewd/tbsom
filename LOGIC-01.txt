# Logical Statements, Negations and Conjugations

### Logical statement (proposition)
A **logical statement** is a statement with a well defined truth value.
It is either **true** (**T**) or **false** (**F**), but not both.

Examples:
- Mars is a planet (True logical statement)
- Pluto is a planet (False logical statement)
- $1 + 1 = 2$ (True logical statement)
- The number 5 is smaller than the number 2 (False logical statement)
- Good morning! (Not a logical statement)
- $x + 1 = 1$ (Not a logical statement because the truth value depends on the value of x)

### Logical operations

##### Negation
For a logical statement $A$, $\neg A$ denotes the negation.

Examples:
- $A$ = The wine bottle is full
- $\neg A$ = The wine bottle is not full
- $A = "2 + 2 = 5"$
- $\neg A = "2 + 2 \neq 5"$

The action of the negation on a logical statement can be summarized
in the following table:

| A |$\neg A|
|---|-------|
| T | F |
| F | T |


##### Conjuction
For two logical statements $A$, $B$, $A \land B$ denotes the conjunction.
The conjunction is true only when both statements are true.

The truth value of the resulting proposition can be summarized in the
following table:

| A | B | $A \land B |
|---|---|---|
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | F |
